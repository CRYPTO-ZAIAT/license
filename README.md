• Why is ZAIAT coin not listed?
ZAIAT coin utilizes CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY, a second-generation cryptocurrency technology. CT has become incompatible with the old Blockchain as it has addressed the issues prevalent in the first-generation crypto market through innovation. Let's outline some problems with first-generation cryptocurrencies:

• First Generation Crypto Problems
Coin inflation
All coins are created one after another, preserving the existing shortcomings. Their desire to innovate has been virtually non-existent. Profits flow through traditional channels - founders and those with substantial financial resources who can leverage their financial volume for gains or losses, or those who can lock their funds for longer periods. The losers remain the same.



At least 95% of the existing 20,000 types of coins can raise reasonable suspicions.
To understand this better, please analyze the rise and fall of all coins at a high level when BTC - BITCOIN increases or decreases. All coins rise immediately when BTC increases and fall as soon as BTC drops. To comprehend this further, it is essential to know that all coins should ideally decrease based on existing investments, not BTC fluctuations. If BTC has increased by 100% overnight, other coins should ideally receive the same level of currency inflow as BTC to grow by 100%, but this is not the reality. The growth is based on speculation, not investment, which is why many people lose their invested money.



Listing coins on multiple cryptocurrency directories or trading platforms.


Many clone coins are listed on multiple directories (crypto websites) and trading platforms because they pay certain fees periodically. CAUTION! This does not mean that these coins are secure, and everything will be fine in the future. Nowadays, listings are based on fees and "trust." Why are fees justified to be paid, and what is the motive and consequence of "trust"? 95% of first-generation cryptocurrencies do not display the real MARKET CAP! Just as you read above, 95% of existing coins do not display the true total value present in their market capitalization.

• The listing of the ZAIAT coin


ZAIAT will never list its coin on directories (websites that require payment for listing) because ZAIAT is based on CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY, belonging to the second generation of CRYPTO.



At present, Crinception Technology has technologically structured the Zaiat crypto project, and there is certainty, through its new innovations, that the establishment of a platform is necessary to showcase not only the innovations but also meet the expectations of the future.



The current platforms do not meet the needs of existing innovations achieved by Crinception Technology. Therefore, a new platform will be developed to meet the technical requirements that are expected to prevail in the near future. Crinception Technology has already designed and is currently developing this platform.



All platforms that incorporate these new technologies will have the potential to be listed in the future and will be validated by Crinception Technology as compliant with second-generation crypto projects.



It is unquestionable that second-generation crypto projects will represent the sole future of crypto.



ZAIAT is licensed by CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY and will be listed on the official website CRINCEPTION.COM, where starting from January 1, 2024, only coins that legally utilize this technology will be listed.



• What does CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY (the second generation of CRYPTO) offer?


Growth only through transaction fee validation!


No coin utilizing CRINCEPTION technology can decrease under any circumstances because the blockchain naturally ensures its growth based on transaction fees. On the official Crinception.com website, you will find precise details on how CT coins can grow without employing any pyramid schemes.

Every company legally employing CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY will ensure 24/7 wallet security for its holders. CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY will primarily guarantee that no blockchain will be hacked, and each company will ensure there is insurance for every wallet.
CT - CRINCEPTION TECHNOLOGY will ensure that even if a company goes bankrupt, no coin from CT-licensed wallets will be confiscated or blocked by that company.
